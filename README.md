# SC1015-Mini-Project-Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction

Welcome to our project on analyzing customer satisfaction data for an airline company! We are a team of three from Nanyang Technological University - Yaxin, Nivedha, and Chaw Kay. The dataset for this project is obtained from Kaggle and contains the data sourced from a survey conducted by airlines on the satisfaction level of passengers/customers based on various factors. With 25 columns such as Age, Gender, Travel class, Arrival and Departure delays, and features that influence customer satisfaction level such as On-board service, Cleanliness, Seat comfort, and Baggage handling, we aim to identify critical factors that impact passenger satisfaction with airline services and provide insights to improve customer service and maintain customer loyalty.






## Background

Passenger satisfaction is a critical factor for the success of any airline. Satisfied passengers are more likely to become loyal customers, provide positive reviews, and recommend the airline to others. On the other hand, dissatisfied passengers may switch to other airlines or share negative feedback, which can impact an airline's reputation and bottom line. Therefore, understanding the factors that influence passenger satisfaction is essential for airlines to improve their services and maintain customer loyalty.

## The Research Question

Our goal is to provide suggestions to the airline company on which categories of services are mainly affecting customer satisfaction and which areas need improvement to attract new customers and retain loyal ones. Through our analysis, we aim to identify significant variables, patterns, and trends that could impact customer service in the aviation industry. Our approach involves creating a classification model from the flight satisfaction survey data to answer the following research question:

"What patterns, trends, and significant variables can be identified from analyzing the airline passenger satisfaction dataset that impact passenger satisfaction levels? Specifically, what are the critical factors that have a significant impact on passenger satisfaction with airline services to improve customer service and maintain customer loyalty in the aviation industry?"
